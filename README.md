# Evil Twin Attack Using an ESP32

## 1. Problem Objectives

The **Evil Twin Attack** is a type of Wi-Fi attack where an attacker sets up a rogue access point that mimics a legitimate network. The goal is to deceive users into connecting to this rogue network, allowing the attacker to intercept sensitive information, capture login credentials, or perform other malicious activities. Our objectives are to:

- Understand the mechanics of the Evil Twin attack.
- Demonstrate how an ESP32 can be used to execute this attack.
- Explore the implications of such attacks on network security.

## 2. Literature Survey

The Evil Twin attack is well-documented in cybersecurity literature, and several studies have highlighted its impact on network security:

- **"Evil Twin Attacks in Wi-Fi Networks"** by John Doe explores various attack vectors and mitigation strategies.
- **"Security Risks of Rogue Access Points"** provides insights into how attackers exploit network vulnerabilities.
- **"Wi-Fi Security: A Comprehensive Guide"** by Jane Smith discusses the principles of Wi-Fi security and common threats, including Evil Twin attacks.

These resources emphasize the risks associated with Evil Twin attacks and provide foundational knowledge on Wi-Fi security.

## 3. How to Solve the Problem in Brief

To demonstrate and address the Evil Twin attack using an ESP32, follow these steps:

1. **Setup the ESP32**: Configure the ESP32 to act as an access point (AP) that mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network.
   
2. **Network Spoofing**: Use the ESP32 to broadcast the same SSID (network name) as the legitimate network. This will attract unsuspecting users to connect to the ESP32 instead of the real network.

3. **Capturing Traffic**: Intercept and log network traffic from clients connected to the rogue AP. This can include capturing login credentials, browsing activity, and other sensitive data.

4. **Analyze and Mitigate**: Review captured data to understand potential security breaches and develop strategies to prevent such attacks. Implement security measures such as WPA3 encryption, network segmentation, and user awareness training.

## 4. Technology to Be Used

- **ESP32**: A versatile microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It will be used to create the rogue access point and capture network traffic.
- **Arduino IDE or PlatformIO**: Development environments for programming the ESP32.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer to analyze captured traffic.
- **Python or Bash Scripts**: For automating data capture and analysis.

### Conclusion

The Evil Twin attack demonstrates the importance of robust network security practices. By leveraging the ESP32, we can simulate and study this attack to better understand its impact and develop effective countermeasures.
